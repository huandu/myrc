# My Personal `rc` Files #

I'm tired of copying `rc` files from one place to another. Let me start to use github as a central storage to sync these files.

## Install ##

```
# Get source.
git clone https://github.com/huandu/myrc.git

# Replace rc files in `$HOME`. Old files are backed up in `$HOME/.myrc/backup`.
myrc/install.sh
```
